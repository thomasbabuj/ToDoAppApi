# ToDoAppApi
Making a RESTful JSON API in Go

 1) A Basic Web server
 2) Adding a Router ( using Mux )
		i ) use go get to import external package
		ii) we create a basic router, adds the route "/"
           and assign the index handler to run when the endpoint is called
 3)  Adding additional basic router
 4)  A basic Todo model
		i) In Golang, a Struct will typically serve as model.
 5)  Creating idiomatic JSON

		   struct will be marshalled to JSON
 6)  Code refactoring
